# drum-kit

~About the WebPage~
I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make this webpage. 
It has several buttons with letters and background images of each drum type.
When a button is clicked, corresponding sound is heard with an animation on the button that lasts for 0.1 sec.
This sound and animation is also seen when the key of the letter is pressed on keyboard.
